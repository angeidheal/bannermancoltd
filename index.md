Bannerman Company Ltd is a family-owned and operated company based in Tain, Ross-shire.

Our roots trace back to the 1960s when we had just three employees processing prawn tails in Tain before expanding into a purpose-built factory where our small team produces premium quality Scottish scampi.

We have over 50 years of experience in the haulage industry moving goods such as grains, aggregates, sawn timber and timber residues throughout the Scottish Highlands and mainland UK.

The company has continued to expand into new industries with a bark processing plant, warehousing, car dealerships and fuel stations.
